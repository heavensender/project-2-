## Technologies Used:

-   **Express** is a back end web application framework for Node.js
-   **Express-session** is used to store the user state with each given being assigned a unique session
-   **MongoDB** is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.
-   **EJS** is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript
-   **Dotenv** is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables. It allows you to separate secrets from source code
-   **Skeleton** is used for CSS framework for HTML and CSS design templates

## Database:

-   **MongoDB** is a document-oriented NoSQL database that is used to store large amounts of data

## Objective:

-   Make a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) using Node.js, MongoDB, Express and EJS that adheres to MVC (Models, Views, and Controllers) file structure
-   Use a CSS framework

## Approach Taken:

-   Do up basic wireframe to visualize app
-   Set up basic MVC structure with basic CRUD routes
-   Set up database in MongoDB
-   Set up authentication page
-   Test app functions
-   Link app to Heroku

## Wireframe:

## Accomplishments:

-   The app meets the Minimum Viable Product's (MVP) requirements

## Challenges:

-   Acessing shows as it's nested in User schema
-   Realizing too late that split models will definitely make accessibility easier

## Further Improvements:

-   Split models and use reference instead
-   Social App: Different user interactions (e.g. comment on other users' page, follow other users)
-   Filter shows (e.g. alphabetical order, completed, category etc.)
-   Input option to upload photos instead of using url
